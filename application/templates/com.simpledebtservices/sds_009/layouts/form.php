                            We predominately use "session" cookies, which are not permanently stored on your hard drive. Session cookies expire after two hours of inactivity or when you close your browser. When you carry out the purchase of a service or product on our website, a large amount of data is processed by our system and transferred through each page of the search or registration. This information includes all information you input on a registration page or questionnaire you complete as part of the registration process as well as demographic information that is not unique to you. "Session" cookies allow us to keep track of this data until you have completed your search or registration.

                            <u><i>Web Beacons</i></u>:  We also use electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs, clear gifs or action tags) that allow us to collect certain information about your visit to certain web pages (including the number of users who have visited those pages), measure and improve the effectiveness of advertisements, and deliver services. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information. Rather, they are a technique used to compile aggregated statistics about website usage.  Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of page view and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. This information may be shared with one or more third parties so that they can understand the kinds of visitors to the Web pages, how those visitors use those Web Pages, and the effectiveness of their advertisements. We may also use web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in our database.

                            <u><i>Disabling Web Beacons</i></u>:  Because Web beacons are the same as any other content request, you cannot opt out or refuse them.  However, they can be rendered ineffective by either opting out of cookies or changing the cookie setup in your browser.

                            <u><i>IP Addresses</i></u>:  We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the site.  We may use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on the site or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address. Your Internet Protocol ("IP") is a unique Internet "address" which is assigned to you by your Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). For local area network ("LAN"), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by Web servers, which collect information about a user's traffic patterns.  While an IP address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the Web. Your IP address can also reveal what geographic area you are connecting from or which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages.
