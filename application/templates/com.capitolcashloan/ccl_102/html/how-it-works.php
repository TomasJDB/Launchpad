<p>This  website is a FREE matching service, providing you access to <strong>multiple lenders</strong> with a wide array of financial products. We are NOT a lender. All  you have to do is create one simple consumer profile, and we will contact the  lenders in our network and submit your profile in order to find you the best  product offerings you may qualify for. These products include mid and short  term installment loans, payday loans, and merchandise credit lines. </p>
<p>Installment  loans are often longer term loans that give you more time to pay back and often  have lower interest rates and fees, and payday loans are the quick and  convenient way to get extra cash until your next paycheck. They can help you to  avoid late payment penalties and bounced check fees, pay urgent bills or cover  emergency expenses. In addition, with payday loans you can often get the funds  wired directly into your checking account, sometimes as soon as the same  business day. </p>
<p>Your  loan terms will vary from lender to lender, and will also vary by which product  you ultimately accept. Your repayment terms will be dictated by your  actual loan agreement. For installment loans, repayment is often on a monthly  schedule that you and your lender set up, and is usually made by a direct debit  from your checking account. For payday loans, repayment is almost always the  date the borrower receives their next paycheck, and the lender will also debit  some amount (either the full loan amount or just the loan fee, as determined  from your loan agreement) directly from your checking account. Please refer to  your specific loan agreement for your repayment terms. Read your lender's  disclosures to make sure the product is appropriate for your needs.</p>
<p><strong>Please  borrow responsibly</strong> â€“ Short term cash loans are not intended for long-term financial needs.</p>
<p>Merchandise  credit lines will allow you to buy thousands of items online, with little or no  down payment, and finance those purchases at 0% interest. IN ALL CASES,  you will be provided all fee disclosures and terms UPFRONT, and there is no  obligation or loan commitment on your part until you decide you like and want  the terms. Merchandise credit lines are not loans, and a membership fee  is required.</p>
